 Mass Cancel / Move All Subscribe & Save items in Bulk

Like many of you, I take advantage of the Amazon S&S discounts for various products to save money... But I don't typically want the item at full price the next subscription interval.

I've seen posts in the past on reddit from redditors wondering if there is a way to mass cancel subscribe and save items. I have a personal investment in this request because I have so many items I shuffle every month, and canceling them 1 by 1 is going to take me forever.

I present to you two items I've written:
JavaScript Bookmarklet to cancel every single subscribe and save item

How to use:

    Visit this URL: https://www.amazon.com/auto-deliveries/subscriptionList?listFilter=active

    Press the "Show more subscriptions" button until you can see every item you're subscribed to

    Click on the bookmarklet that you created (steps below)

    Every subscription will open in a new tab and automatically cancel (This step may take some time depending on how many items you have. I had to step away and make coffee)

How to create the bookmarklet (CHROME)

    Right click on your bookmark bar and press "add page..."

    Name the bookmark whatever you'd like (I called it S&S Cancel All')

    Paste the following code into the URL (then press save) Sometimes code here is auto formatted by reddit, here is the raw code: https://pastebin.com/rHp6Ca1X

    javascript:(function(){let baseUrl="https://www.amazon.com/auto-deliveries/ajax/cancelSubscriptionAction?actionType=cancelSubscription&canceledNextDeliveryDate=1730880000000&subscriptionId=";let spans=document.querySelectorAll(%27span[data-action="edit-link-subscription-tablet"]%27);let subscriptionIds=[...spans].map(span=>{let data=span.getAttribute(%27data-edit-link-subscription-tablet%27);let match=data.match(/subscriptionId=([&"]+)/);return match?match[1]:null;}).filter(id=>id);console.log(Found ${subscriptionIds.length} subscription IDs.);function openNextUrl(index){if(index>=subscriptionIds.length){console.log(%27All URLs have been opened.%27);return;}let id=subscriptionIds[index];let url=baseUrl+id;console.log(Opening URL: ${url});let newWindow=window.open(url,%27_blank%27);setTimeout(()=>{openNextUrl(index+1);},1000);}openNextUrl(0);})();

What does this script do?

    Extracts the SubscriptionId from each item on this page

    Generates the cancellation request URL

    Loads the new URL into a new tab, canceling that product

*Please note that this option will generate 1 email in your inbox per product (amazon does this when you cancel), so you may get flooded with a lot of emails*
Javascript Bookmarklet to move every single subscribe and save item to 6 months in the future

    Visit this URL: https://www.amazon.com/auto-deliveries/subscriptionList?listFilter=active&ref\_=rodx\_mys\_subscriptionFilter\_d\_ret\_active

    Press Bulk Edit Schedule At the top

    Click on the bookmarklet that you created (steps below)

    Seconds later all of your items are now moved 6 months into the future

How to create the bookmarklet (CHROME)

    Right click on your bookmark bar and press "add page..."

    Name the bookmark whatever you'd like (I called it S&S Mover')

    Paste the following code into the URL (then press save) Sometimes code here is auto formatted by reddit, here is the raw code: https://pastebin.com/VG22fTUD

    javascript:(function(){let clickMoreSubscriptions=()=>{let e=document.querySelector('.a-section.subscription-pagination-trigger-container span[data-action="bulk-edit-pagination-action"] > .subscription-pagination-trigger');if(!e||e.parentElement.classList.contains('aok-hidden')){console.log('No more subscriptions to show or button is hidden.'),selects=[...document.querySelectorAll('select[name="changeNextDeliveryDate"]')],console.log(Found ${selects.length} select elements.),processNextSelect();return}e.click(),console.log('Clicked "Show more subscriptions" button.'),clickMoreSubscriptions.counter===undefined?clickMoreSubscriptions.counter=1:clickMoreSubscriptions.counter++,clickMoreSubscriptions.counter<=50?setTimeout(clickMoreSubscriptions,1e3):console.log(%27Stopped after 50 clicks.%27)};let selects=undefined;let processNextSelect=()=>{if(0===selects.length)return console.log(%27All select boxes processed!%27);let e=selects.shift(),t=e.options,n=t[t.length-1],s=e.value;if(s===n.value)return console.log(%27already set, skipping subscription%27),void setTimeout(processNextSelect,100);console.log(%27Changing select element:%27,e),console.log(Current value: ${s}, New value: ${n.value}),e.value=n.value;let o=new Event(%27change%27,{bubbles:!0});e.dispatchEvent(o);let r=e.closest(%27form%27).querySelector(%27.a-button-input%27);r&&r.click(),setTimeout(processNextSelect,100)};clickMoreSubscriptions()})();

What does this script do?

    Auto expands the page so all your items show up ("Show more subscriptions" )

    Finds all the items on the page that have a drop down date, and selects the last option (6 months away)

    Auto-Clicks the "Apply" button for you

I tested this on my amazon account using chrome, if it doesn't work for you let me know and I can try my best to assist. Enjoy :)
